This folder contains the released versions of the FFXIV ACT Plugin.

Installation of this plugin should normally be performed using the Advanced Combat Tracker Startup wizard, and updates will automatically be polled from there.  However, I will archive past versions here in case a user wants to manually download an older version due to newly-introduced bugs.
